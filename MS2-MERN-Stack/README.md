# MERN-STACK MILESTONE PROJECT
Authors: Andrew Thompson, Jorge Gonzalez, Kaleab Abateneh

## Project Idea

We aim to create a psuedo-clone of LinkedIn where the site is less dedicated towards the mainstream social media platform, i.e., fewer miscellaneous articles and more on networking and job requisitions. 

The main page will contain job postings, job fairs, etc., created by users visible to those inside there network and a few steps out (That is connections of connections). This could be extended to a basic user profile page with their connections, as well as, their postings in some given order. 




## Requirements

### General Requirements
- This is a group project!
- This game cannot be an assignment we've already done in class.
- This application must run in a web browser.
- This application must be tracked in GitHub, with a minimum of 20 commits.
- Your empty project repository must be up on GitHub on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.
- This application must be deployed! You will need to use a service like Heroku, as this project will need to have a deployed back-end.

### Application Requirements
- Your application must be a full-stack application using your own front and back-end.
- Your application should use full CRUD functionality with the database.
- Your application should be a complete product.
- Your application must be deployed online using deployment sites like Heroku or Netlify.
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
- You should use several sensibly named components in React
- The application should have a Readme.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the inspiration for the application, how to use the application, lists the technologies used to build the application, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality

### Bonus Ideas
- Utilize an external styling library for React like React-Bootstrap or Material UI.
- Explore NPM packages that will help in the logic of your application.
- Try to use the StateProvider in Redux to manipulate the state of your application.

## Grading Scale
| Domain | What are we looking for? |
| --- | --- |
| User Experience | Was effort put into styling? Does this Application have a goos User Experience? Is the U.ser Interface intuitive? Can I comfortably navigate without using the backward and forward buttons on my browser?|
| Functionality | Is the app usable? Do all features work? |
| Workflow | Did you use GitHub properly? Is there a readme? |
| Code Style | Does the code follow best practices/naming conventions? Is it DRY? |
| Presentation | Did the group present the project to the class and did all group members participate in the presentation? Is the site deployed where others can access? |
